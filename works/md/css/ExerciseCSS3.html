        The <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/12726/SUMMER_SALE/">Steam Summer Sale</a> is a treasure trove of deals, offering huge discounts on countless games for a fraction of their usual prices. 
    While many of the games come from major developers like Square Enix, Capcom, and more, the Steam Summer Sale is a perfect time for fans 
    of video games to pick up a selection from one of the many indie developers offering their games at discounted prices.
        
        One indie group, the Korean studio <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/ProjMoonStudio">Project Moon</a>, offers unique gameplay experiences for fans of horror and story-focused games with their titles: 
    Lobotomy Corporation and <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1256670/Library_Of_Ruina/">Library of Ruina</a>. While the two games are drastically different in terms of gameplay and style, players may enjoy the interesting
     -- and sometimes horrifying -- experiences that each title offers, and for half the usual price.

        Project Moon's first title, <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/568220/Lobotomy_Corporation__Monster_Management_Simulation/">Lobotomy Corporation</a>, puts players in the shoes of the Manager of the titular corporation. Taking inspiration from SCP Foundation, 
    the horror movie The Cabin in the Woods, and the sci-fi series Warehouse 13, players oversee the day-to-day operations of the company by ordering employees to 
    interact with the many monsters housed at their facility. This is easier said than done, as over the course of the game, more and more departments and employees 
    are added, as are more monsters to oversee.

        Using strategy and careful management, players can use their cute, simply-drawn employees to study and interact with dozens of different monsters, 
    referred to in-game as "<a target="_blank" href="https://lobotomycorp.fandom.com/wiki/Abnormalities">Abnormalities</a>". While Lobotomy Corporation is a management game at its core, it's filled with horror elements. Many of the abnormalities have 
    unnerving, terrifying designs, the employees can go mad with fear, and interacting incorrectly with some abnormalities can result in fourth wall-shattering jump scares. 
    Occasionally, the abnormalities will breach their containment, leaving it up to the players to help their employees survive the onslaught and get the creatures back into 
    their cells.

        Players aren't expected to go about managing a facility of monsters alone, however. Lobotomy Corporation introduces a cast of colorful characters called the <a target="_blank" href="https://lobotomycorp.fandom.com/wiki/Sephirah">Sephirah</a>, 
    who oversee the different departments of the facility. Players are also introduced to <a target="_blank" href="https://lobotomycorp.fandom.com/wiki/Angela">Angela</a>, an AI assistant that helps them throughout the game. As each day progresses, 
    players uncover more of the dark history behind the corporation and the truth behind Angela and the Sephirah, which culminates in one of four endings, depending on 
    how much of the game players have completed.
